**Design requirements:**

* Modern, minimal, high-contrast; subtle shadows; large tap targets; smooth but restrained animations (prefers CSS over heavy JS).
* Image handling: lazy-load, responsive `srcset`, WebP/AVIF fallbacks.
* Icons: use a lightweight icon set (or inline SVGs).
* Form UX: inline validation, accessible labels/ARIA, honeypot or basic spam guard.

**SEO & structured data:**

* Per-page `<title>` and meta description.
* JSON-LD:

  * `LocalBusiness` (address/phone/hours) on Home & Contact
  * `Service` for key repair categories on Repairs
  * `Product` for Crackercaster models on Custom Guitars
  * `FAQPage` on FAQ (if you add one)
* Open Graph/Twitter cards; default social image.

**Performance & quality:**

* Lighthouse target ≥ 95 for Performance/Best Practices/SEO, ≥ 90 for Accessibility.
* No layout shift on core pages; pre-size images; use system fonts or one performance-friendly webfont with `swap`.
* Bundle splitting and code-splitting for routes.

**Content placeholders:**

* Replace all images with placeholders.
* Stub 3–5 testimonials.
* Hours: Mon–Fri 10–6, Sat 10–4, Sun Closed (placeholder—make editable).
* Add TODOs where backend/services will be wired (form handling, storage, CMS).

**Accessibility:**

* Semantic landmarks (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `footer`).
* Keyboard focus visible; trap in modals; skip-to-content link.
* Alt text generator for gallery placeholders (use filename to seed).

**Deliverables:**

* Multi-page site scaffold with routes above.
* Reusable component library.
* Sample content filled with the facts in this brief.
* README with:

  * Build/run instructions
  * Where to replace images/content
  * How to add posts to `/blog`
  * TODOs for backend (form submit endpoint, storage, CMS)

**Extra:**

* Add a simple `/quote` landing that mirrors the Contact form and is CTA-optimized.
* Add a site-wide JSON config (shop name, phone, address, hours) for single-source edits.
